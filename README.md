# FIRdata

##Purpose
This repository serves as the free version of IPFS for our smart police system.

##Why Git?
- Git is Free.
- It's a distributed control system, with logs of each action, thus making it ideal for our application in which we wanted a decentralised storage along with the ability to roll back.
